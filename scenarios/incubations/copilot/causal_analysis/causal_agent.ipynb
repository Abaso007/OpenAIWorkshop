       "\"The performance issue you are experiencing with your application appears to be related to the web server rather than the database server. Here's what I found:\\n\\n1. **Web Server**: The average response time is currently very high at 550.74 milliseconds. Moreover, there is a significant error rate of 54%, which could indicate issues like misconfigurations, server overload, resource constraints, or problems with the server's software or hardware.\\n\\n2. **Database Server**: There are no slow-running queries or table scans affecting the performance of the database. The queries seem to be running within acceptable limits, as there are no entries in the logs for queries that exceed the 5-second (5000 milliseconds) threshold.\\n\\nGiven this information, the focus should be on resolving the web server issues. Specifically, the high error rate needs to be addressed as it's likely contributing to the increased response time. This could involve checking for issues such as excessive traffic leading to server overload, potential bugs in the server software, insufficient server resources, or other irregularities in the server performance.\\n\\nIf you have the capability to adjust the configuration or resources of the web server, it might be necessary to allocate more resources to handle the load or to scale out the number of servers. In case of suspected software issues, reviewing recent code deployments or changes in configurations could shed light on the root cause of the problem. If these tasks seem beyond your current abilities, I would recommend getting in touch with a web server administrator or an IT specialist for further assistance.\""
