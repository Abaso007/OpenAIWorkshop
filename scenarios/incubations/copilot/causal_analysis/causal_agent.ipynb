      "\n",
      "1. **Web Server's Performance**:\n",
      "   - The current average response time on the web server is very high at 550.74 milliseconds, which is well above the expected average of 100 milliseconds.\n",
      "   - There is also a significant error rate of 54% encountered on the web server. This error rate is unusually high and could be a major contributing factor to the overall slow performance you are experiencing.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Database Server's Performance**:\n",
      "   - Upon checking the database server, it seems that there are no slow-running queries that exceed the threshold of 1000 milliseconds. This indicates that the slow performance is not due to the database queries themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given these findings, it appears the primary issue originates from the web server side of the application, which is both slow to respond and encountering a high volume of errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "To address the immediate concerns:\n",
      "- **For the web server issues**: The high error rate needs to be investigated further to identify the root causes of these errors. The errors could relate to server overload, misconfiguration, faults in the application code, or potential network issues. It's important to review the web server logs in detail to understand the specific error messages being generated.\n",
      "- **For the database server**: While the database does not currently show slow-running queries, it's still a good practice to periodically review query performance and optimize indices and configurations to ensure it does not become a bottleneck in the future.\n",

      "The investigation into the application's performance issue has revealed the following information:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Web Server's Performance**:\n",
      "   - The current average response time on the web server is very high at 550.74 milliseconds, which is well above the expected average of 100 milliseconds.\n",
      "   - There is also a significant error rate of 54% encountered on the web server. This error rate is unusually high and could be a major contributing factor to the overall slow performance you are experiencing.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Database Server's Performance**:\n",
      "   - Upon checking the database server, it seems that there are no slow-running queries that exceed the threshold of 1000 milliseconds. This indicates that the slow performance is not due to the database queries themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given these findings, it appears the primary issue originates from the web server side of the application, which is both slow to respond and encountering a high volume of errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "To address the immediate concerns:\n",
      "- **For the web server issues**: The high error rate needs to be investigated further to identify the root causes of these errors. The errors could relate to server overload, misconfiguration, faults in the application code, or potential network issues. It's important to review the web server logs in detail to understand the specific error messages being generated.\n",
      "- **For the database server**: While the database does not currently show slow-running queries, it's still a good practice to periodically review query performance and optimize indices and configurations to ensure it does not become a bottleneck in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "You may need to consult with your web server administrator or development team to resolve the web server errors and improve response time. Additionally, regular maintenance and monitoring of both the web servers and database servers are recommended to prevent and quickly resolve any future performance issues.\n"
